\subsection{End-to-End Evaluation}
\todo{We take the best featurization from the previous section and apply it to the following datasets}

\subsubsection{Synthetic Example}
A Synthetic example with a robot in blue and target in yellow is shown in \figref{toyEx}. The robot moves to the target, and a new target appears after that robot has reached the current target. For the example, we have 4 targets. For each demonstration episode, the target $i$ is sampled from  $\sim\,\mathcal{N}(\mu_i, 1)$ where $\mu_i$ is randomly generated in the first episode and maintained constant across subsequent episodes. For these example, we generate 5 episodes of each individual test.

\figref{toyEx} (b) shows the results of unsupervised segmentation into the 4 steps -- each time the robot reaches the target, using only kinematics data ($\binom{x(t)}{y(t)}$). The results for this preliminary example align the transitions with changes in directions robots motions affirming out model for hierarchical clustering. 

We further evaluate the effect of partial observability, by reducing the state dimension to only $(x(t))$. As expected, the our method only has a component of the gradient, and hence the uncertainty on the output transitions increases, albeit around the correct mean. 

Next, we introduce control noise in the system, $x(t+1) = x(t)+u(t)+\nu$, where $\nu\, \sim\, \mathcal{N}(0, d_1)$ where varying $d_1\in[0,1]$. The \figref{toyEx} (c) shows the results for $d_1=0.25$. Similar to the previous experiment we experiment with full kinematics along with partial observability. We find that in case of noise, one dimensional trajectory can have drifts which would erroneously show up as transitions. 
We also evaluate the performance of segmentation using only Visual features, specifically SIFT features. We observe that the segments are correctly identified, however due to the nature of SIFT feautures, transitions have longer time lengths.
Finally, we note that a combination of Kinematics and Visual features allows disambiguation from noise, and hence allows for sharper transition clusters than either of those independently. 

Next, we introduce a kinematic sensor noise in the system $\hat{x}(t)= x(t)+\nu$, where $\nu\, \sim\, \mathcal{N}(0, d_2)$ where varying $d_2\in[0,1]$. The \figref{toyEx} (c) shows the results for $d_2=0.25$. We note that only the kinematics is corrupted with noise, while the vision sees a perfectly straight trajectory. We first segment using full kinematic state. Thereafter we use partially observed state as in the aforementioned case. We observe that in this case, the segmentation performance substantially degrades. Then, we use SIFT visual features as in previous experiment. We find improved transitions based only on videos. We then combine with partially observed state, this results in slight improvement, and combination with full kinematics state with noise yields drastic improvements in segmentaiton performance.

We apply our method to the JIGSAWS dataset\cite{gao2014jigsaws} consisting of surgical activity for human motion modeling. The dataset was captured using the da Vinci Surgical System from eight surgeons with different levels of skill performing five repetitions each of suturing and needle passing.

\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent\textbf{Suturing: }Next, we explored 39 examples of a 4 throw suturing task (\figref{suturing}). Using the right arm, the first step is to penetrate one of the points on right side. The next step is to force the needle through the phantom to the other side. Using the left arm, the robot pulls the needle out of the phantom, and then hands it off to the right arm for the next point. 


\vspace{0.5em}
\noindent\textbf{Needle Passing: } We applied our framework to 28 demonstrations of the needle passing task.
The robot passes a needle through a loop using its right arm, then its left arm to pull the needle through the loop. Then, the robot hands the needle off from the left arm to the right arm. This is repeated four times as illustrated with a manual segmentation in 
\figref{needlePassing}.
