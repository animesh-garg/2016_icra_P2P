\section{Latent State $H_t$}
Describe the process of linking kinematics and video (PCA, CCA, etc.).
If we apply any VLAD or encoding, or batching, describe it here:

\begin{itemize}
\item Encoding - Current Status
\begin{itemize}
\item So I've implemented the following encoding method- Latent Content Descriptors (LCD) + VLAD. However, initial results weren't great and I need to see how it performs on milestones clustering.
\end{itemize}

\item Temporal Batching - Current Status
\begin{itemize}
\item While batching is supposed to help in video analysis , I've seen good separation of clusters (PCA on conv features) with just individual frames without clustering... I think I need to look into this more and need to test it out with milestones clustering.
\end{itemize}

\end{itemize}
